make sure you have:
~/.kube/config

# Requirements

## Set up sudo to support passwordless interaction

There are several ways to do this. The easiest is to add/uncomment the line in /etc/sudoers:
```%admin  ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL```

## Install dependencies
proxy-kube.py currently has dependencies on ghost, haproxy, and python3. This document assumes you'll install packages via brew.

### Packages
```
brew install python3 haproxy
gem install ghost
```

### Python modules and environment
virtualenv -p python3 ~/virtualenv/proxy-kube
source ~/virtualenv/proxy-kube/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# You should now be able to run
./proxy-kube.py

NOTE: you'll need to run:
source ~/virtualenv/proxy-kube/bin/activate
prior to executing this script from now on unless you do other things, like add that to your .bashrc or something..
