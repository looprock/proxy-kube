make sure you have:
~/.kube/config

brew install python3
virtualenv -p python3 ~/virtualenv/proxy-kube
source ~/virtualenv/proxy-kube/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
./proxy-kube.py

NOTE: you'll need to run:
source ~/virtualenv/proxy-kube/bin/activate 
prior to executing this script from now on unless you do other things, like add that to your .bashrc or something..
